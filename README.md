A repository that you can use for creating mods for Reconquer Online or for submitting user-contributed 3D assets.

# Mods

Copy the assets you would like to modify into a new folder. See the "example_mod" folder. Modify them using Blender/Inkscape/Audacity/MuseScore etc. When you're done, compress the folder into a zip file. You can then load the mod into the game under the "Settings" dialogue.

The example mod changes the song in the grasslands, the grass texture, the sound when a player is damaged, modifies a segment near the grassland border, and edits the chicken mesh and chicken walk animation. 

# Contributions

You must own the copyright to the asset and release it under CC-BY or CC0. When you upload the asset, include a file called "license.txt" in the same directory.

It should look something like:
```
"Asset Name" by "Name/Pen Name/Github Name", released under CCO (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt)
```
Or
```
"Asset Name" by "Name/Pen Name/Github Name", released under CC-BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)
```
Monsters generally have animations for idle, walk, attack, and die. Sometimes they have multiple attack animations.

The environment follows a grid pattern for walkable tiles, although it doesn't need to be a grid. Any walkable area can't have any part of the environment above it.

Items Need to fit within a 1x1 square.

There are four example items included in this repository.

Alternatively, you can instead upload assets to a site like [poly.pizza](https://poly.pizza) and release them under CC0/CC-BY there.
